/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Domain types.

   Two trees matter in this app and they are deliberately kept apart:

   1. HostNode  - the *saved* connection catalogue. Persisted, user-organised,
                  arbitrarily nested. Survives app restarts.
   2. Session   - a *live* connection. Ephemeral, flat (tabs don't nest), and
                  always points back at a Host by id rather than embedding it,
                  so renaming a saved host updates every open tab for free.
